TEXT FILE ANALYSER 

INSTALLATION

1)
	a) Run "git clone https://github.com/nickpape94/Text-File-Analyser.git" in target folder
	b) Or extract from the email to target folder

2) Ensure Java is installed on your operating system, and open the folder up in your favourite IDE or text editor

3) Within src/main/java in FileReading.java, you'll find the declared string  'fileInput' right below the class FileReading:
	
	public static String fileInput = "C:\\Users\\Nick-\\Java-Projects\\test3.txt";

Here, between the quotation marks, enter the location of the text file on your disc that you want to analyse. 

4) Save with ctrl+s 

5) Run Maven clean and then Maven install

6) Run FileReading.java to display the results of the analysis to the console 

7) Every time you want to analyse a new .txt file, just update fileInput with the location of the desired file. 


TESTS

1) After running Maven install, a Jacoco code coverage report will be generated within target/site/jacoco/jacoco-resources/index.html for you to view at your discretion

(The unit tests built for this program are located in src/test/java)


ASSUMPTIONS MADE

- Based on the example given, I wrote the program with the intent that any date in the format dd/mm/yyyy (or similar) would be considered as a word, and thus would not be discounted from the analysis.

- The splitDeliminator right below the file input are the variables I decided to eliminate during the split of the text document. So I did my best to ensure that any trailing white space or non-alphanumeric characters (baring the exception of ampersands and slashes) would not contribute to the analysis of a word.
